This role requires a strong coding focus so it is important that you have fluent programming skills and a strong grasp of computer science/software engineering fundamentals. Working in an Agile environment with a CI philosophy employed you will need to enjoy keeping current with new technologies, tools and methodologies and how they can be practically employed. Alternatively, first class Insights Analyst's will be considered regardless of level of coding although the more the merrier is my clients thoughts on this.
The ability to thrive is an environment where your core focus is complex problem solving on a daily basis is key. Candidates can come from a diverse set of disciplines so what is important is that you can combine Advanced Analytics qualities with software development qualities and have a decent level of commercial and organisational awareness as you apply your Data Science expertise to solve business problems.
This is an exciting time to be joining my client as they continue their growth internationally and continue to innovate in a vast variety of ways (e.g. Self Service Analytics/AI arena. Whilst these roles require first class technical capabilities equally important is the ability to understand business problems, business context, have a grasp of organisational and commercial realities and incorporate effectively all these diverse factors into the analytical features/services and algorithms that you build.
Any candidates with experience in Conversational AI and/or ""Text Analytics and / or Speech Analytics would be at a serious advantage.
My client offers a first class working environment – professional, collegiate and creative all in one. Working alongside some of the finest Data Scientists and Software Engineers anywhere in Australia you can be sure that this role will offer fantastic challenges and opportunities with a real focus on your professional growth. Having a positive attitude towards your own self-development is key.
Ideally I am looking for applications from more Senior candidates (e.g. 5+yrs exp) who can assist with the bigger picture challenges associated with running a high performing product/feature development team although candidates with less experience but who can demonstrate they have the technical and business smarts to succeed in this environment should not hesitate to apply.

I am looking for candidates from either a Software Engineering/Machine Learning background or those from either a Data Science or more traditional Statistical/ Predictive Modelling background who have fluent programming skills (Python and R are essential) and typically have strong academics in a relevant discipline (BSc, MSc, PhD Data Science, Statistics, Actuarial, Computer Science et al) and who wish to join a high performing team involved in practically every aspect/business function possible and are regarded as increasingly essential to business improvement.
Alternatively, If you have solid SQL experience and have real expertise on finding, delivering Insights and turning data into meaningful information that can drive real business (strategic or tactical) decisions and genuinely add value then this could be the role for you.
If you are a Data Scientist who could also walk into a high performing Senior Insights role with a Consulting firm (eg, presentation skills, customer engagement, strategy and planning, insights to find opportunities, drive sales etc.) then stop what you are doing and send me your CV !- I need to speak with you immediately : -)
Working with other Data Scientists, specialist 3rd party teams & key stakeholders, your core role will involve the design, development, testing and deployment of analytically focused algorithms designed to solve business problems. Your tool-kit to deliver on this will include methods and techniques such as Data Visualisation, Natural Language Processing, Statistical & Machine Learning Modelling, BigData etc. Working as part of a high performing team you will work as part of a broader cross-functional group of Data Scientists and Engineers, Back-End Engineers, UX experts so the ability to communicate effectively, enjoy the process of having your ideas positively challenged and also looking to improve your peers output is a key component of my clients culture and expectations for you in this role.
This role requires a strong coding focus so it is important that you have fluent programming skills and a strong grasp of computer science/software engineering fundamentals. Working in an Agile environment with a CI philosophy employed you will need to enjoy keeping current with new technologies, tools and methodologies and how they can be practically employed. Alternatively, first class Insights Analyst's will be considered regardless of level of coding although the more the merrier is my clients thoughts on this.
The ability to thrive is an environment where your core focus is complex problem solving on a daily basis is key. Candidates can come from a diverse set of disciplines so what is important is that you can combine Advanced Analytics qualities with software development qualities and have a decent level of commercial and organisational awareness as you apply your Data Science expertise to solve business problems.
This is an exciting time to be joining my client as they continue their growth internationally and continue to innovate in a vast variety of ways (e.g. Self Service Analytics/AI arena. Whilst these roles require first class technical capabilities equally important is the ability to understand business problems, business context, have a grasp of organisational and commercial realities and incorporate effectively all these diverse factors into the analytical features/services and algorithms that you build.
Any candidates with experience in Conversational AI and/or ""Text Analytics and / or Speech Analytics would be at a serious advantage.
My client offers a first class working environment – professional, collegiate and creative all in one. Working alongside some of the finest Data Scientists and Software Engineers anywhere in Australia you can be sure that this role will offer fantastic challenges and opportunities with a real focus on your professional growth. Having a positive attitude towards your own self-development is key.
Ideally I am looking for applications from more Senior candidates (e.g. 5+yrs exp) who can assist with the bigger picture challenges associated with running a high performing product/feature development team although candidates with less experience but who can demonstrate they have the technical and business smarts to succeed in this environment should not hesitate to apply.

We know people are not bullet points but sure thing!

You have:

Experience developing applications using Apache Spark or similar Hadoop-based big data technologies

Would you describe yourself as intellectually curious and 'obsessed' with new technology?
Is thinking outside the box the only way you think?
Imagine coming to work every day and using your innovative mind to transform the way in which the people in Australia view property.
Domain Group are on the lookout for a head of emerging technology to develop our machine learning capabilities, lead the machine learning team and inspire the product and tech teams at Domain with machine learning!
A bit more about the role:
We have some 'domazing' brains here in the machine learning team. You will establish two scrum teams that are dedicated to machine learning and work to understand where we should focus our machine learning efforts to deliver a return on investment to Domain moving forward.
Yes, we already mentioned how great the machine learning team are but in this role we need you to collaborate outside of that team too. You will need to establish a solid working relationship with our product directors, our Chief Data Officer and his team of data scientists. This means day to day your role will involve a lot of cross collaboration.
As well as putting our employees here at Domain first we ALWAYS have our customers in mind. So your goal will be to focus on using machine learning to create assets that add value to customers.
And after you have done all this great work we want you to share it, we need you to establish a data products forum where the Emerging Tech and Data Science teams can showcase potential implementations and educate and inspire product and tech teams with machine learning.
So no, this isn't a hands on coding role but we do need you to come from a technical background and know a thing or two about how to architect AI systems!
You have landed yourself a pretty awesome bunch to help you achieve this:
In this role you will be lucky enough to sit on the tech leadership team with four other technology directors and will report into the CTO of Domain. Yes they are a hard working and clever bunch but are also a pretty sociable lot, always spotted at Friday drinks, at monthly birthday cakes socialising with their teams and are keen contributors at wider tech events and conferences.
Even your team are celebrities on the technical stage, with members of the machine learning team recently presenting at the Sydney Google Cloud Summit. Not only do we encourage the development of our engineers and employees at conferences, we also promote a flexible working environment and a relaxed dress code too.
When you are in the office we want to make it feel like a home away from home. If ping pong and gaming is your thing you will find the perfect place to take a break. Otherwise you can relax with a session at the gym or grab a large coffee to get you going in the morning, we have that covered with our onsite facilities.
If you think you can handle this lot there are a few things we need you to have:
4+ years of commercial experience with J2EE / .Net web technologies and architecture.
An impressive understanding of web technologies.
4+ years leading and motivating a dynamic team of 8 or more software developers for 4+ years.
Demonstrated experience forming teams around new technologies and capabilities.
A strong belief in the value of modern software development practices and processes, including agile development best practices.
Excellent communication, presentation and influence skills.
Exceptional analytical, troubleshooting and problem solving skills.
The ability to manage time efficiently across concurrent tasks.

418	"Do you get excited when you start visualise a future where technology is driven by smarter machines?
Would you describe yourself as intellectually curious and 'obsessed' with new technology?
Is thinking outside the box the only way you think?
Imagine coming to work every day and using your innovative mind to transform the way in which the people in Australia view property.
Domain Group are on the lookout for a head of emerging technology to develop our machine learning capabilities, lead the machine learning team and inspire the product and tech teams at Domain with machine learning!
A bit more about the role:
We have some 'domazing' brains here in the machine learning team. You will establish two scrum teams that are dedicated to machine learning and work to understand where we should focus our machine learning efforts to deliver a return on investment to Domain moving forward.
Yes, we already mentioned how great the machine learning team are but in this role we need you to collaborate outside of that team too. You will need to establish a solid working relationship with our product directors, our Chief Data Officer and his team of data scientists. This means day to day your role will involve a lot of cross collaboration.
As well as putting our employees here at Domain first we ALWAYS have our customers in mind. So your goal will be to focus on using machine learning to create assets that add value to customers.
And after you have done all this great work we want you to share it, we need you to establish a data products forum where the Emerging Tech and Data Science teams can showcase potential implementations and educate and inspire product and tech teams with machine learning.
So no, this isn't a hands on coding role but we do need you to come from a technical background and know a thing or two about how to architect AI systems!
You have landed yourself a pretty awesome bunch to help you achieve this:
In this role you will be lucky enough to sit on the tech leadership team with four other technology directors and will report into the CTO of Domain. Yes they are a hard working and clever bunch but are also a pretty sociable lot, always spotted at Friday drinks, at monthly birthday cakes socialising with their teams and are keen contributors at wider tech events and conferences.
Even your team are celebrities on the technical stage, with members of the machine learning team recently presenting at the Sydney Google Cloud Summit. Not only do we encourage the development of our engineers and employees at conferences, we also promote a flexible working environment and a relaxed dress code too.
When you are in the office we want to make it feel like a home away from home. If ping pong and gaming is your thing you will find the perfect place to take a break. Otherwise you can relax with a session at the gym or grab a large coffee to get you going in the morning, we have that covered with our onsite facilities.
If you think you can handle this lot there are a few things we need you to have:
4+ years of commercial experience with J2EE / .Net web technologies and architecture.
An impressive understanding of web technologies.
4+ years leading and motivating a dynamic team of 8 or more software developers for 4+ years.
Demonstrated experience forming teams around new technologies and capabilities.
A strong belief in the value of modern software development practices and processes, including agile development best practices.
Excellent communication, presentation and influence skills.
Exceptional analytical, troubleshooting and problem solving skills.
The ability to manage time efficiently across concurrent tasks.

Would you describe yourself as intellectually curious and 'obsessed' with new technology?
Is thinking outside the box the only way you think?
Imagine coming to work every day and using your innovative mind to transform the way in which the people in Australia view property.
Domain Group are on the lookout for a head of emerging technology to develop our machine learning capabilities, lead the machine learning team and inspire the product and tech teams at Domain with machine learning!
A bit more about the role:
We have some 'domazing' brains here in the machine learning team. You will establish two scrum teams that are dedicated to machine learning and work to understand where we should focus our machine learning efforts to deliver a return on investment to Domain moving forward.
Yes, we already mentioned how great the machine learning team are but in this role we need you to collaborate outside of that team too. You will need to establish a solid working relationship with our product directors, our Chief Data Officer and his team of data scientists. This means day to day your role will involve a lot of cross collaboration.
As well as putting our employees here at Domain first we ALWAYS have our customers in mind. So your goal will be to focus on using machine learning to create assets that add value to customers.
And after you have done all this great work we want you to share it, we need you to establish a data products forum where the Emerging Tech and Data Science teams can showcase potential implementations and educate and inspire product and tech teams with machine learning.
So no, this isn't a hands on coding role but we do need you to come from a technical background and know a thing or two about how to architect AI systems!
You have landed yourself a pretty awesome bunch to help you achieve this:
In this role you will be lucky enough to sit on the tech leadership team with four other technology directors and will report into the CTO of Domain. Yes they are a hard working and clever bunch but are also a pretty sociable lot, always spotted at Friday drinks, at monthly birthday cakes socialising with their teams and are keen contributors at wider tech events and conferences.
Even your team are celebrities on the technical stage, with members of the machine learning team recently presenting at the Sydney Google Cloud Summit. Not only do we encourage the development of our engineers and employees at conferences, we also promote a flexible working environment and a relaxed dress code too.
When you are in the office we want to make it feel like a home away from home. If ping pong and gaming is your thing you will find the perfect place to take a break. Otherwise you can relax with a session at the gym or grab a large coffee to get you going in the morning, we have that covered with our onsite facilities.
If you think you can handle this lot there are a few things we need you to have:
4+ years of commercial experience with J2EE / .Net web technologies and architecture.
An impressive understanding of web technologies.
4+ years leading and motivating a dynamic team of 8 or more software developers for 4+ years.
Demonstrated experience forming teams around new technologies and capabilities.
A strong belief in the value of modern software development practices and processes, including agile development best practices.
Excellent communication, presentation and influence skills.
Exceptional analytical, troubleshooting and problem solving skills.
The ability to manage time efficiently across concurrent tasks.
Interested?
Go on then, click apply. We would love to see your application pop up!
So...what happens next?
We'll give your application the attention it deserves (you could be doing so many other things right now!) and you will hear from us either way! If you have the right experience, one of our Recruitment Consultants will give you a call (so make sure you keep your phone handy!) and from there the interviews will commence!

ORGANISATION
UNSW is currently implementing a ten year strategy to 2025 and our ambition for the next decade is nothing less than to establish UNSW as Australia’s global university. We aspire to this in the belief that a great university, which is a global leader in discovery, innovation, impact, education and thought leadership, can make an enormous difference to the lives of people in Australia and around the world.

Following extensive consultation in 2015, we identified three strategic priority areas. Firstly, a drive for academic excellence in research and education. Universities are often classified as ‘research intensive’ or ‘teaching intensive’. UNSW is proud to be an exemplar of both. We are amongst a limited group of universities worldwide capable of delivering research excellence alongside the highest quality education on a large scale. Secondly, a passion for social engagement, which improves lives through advancing equality, diversity, open debate and economic progress. Thirdly, a commitment to achieving global impact through sharing our capability in research and education in the highest quality partnerships with institutions in both developed and emerging societies. We regard the interplay of academic excellence, social engagement and global impact as the hallmarks of a great forward-looking 21st century university.

To achieve this ambition we are attracting the very best academic and professional staff to play leadership roles in our organisation.

Would you describe yourself as intellectually curious and 'obsessed' with new technology?
Is thinking outside the box the only way you think?
Imagine coming to work every day and using your innovative mind to transform the way in which the people in Australia view property.
Domain Group are on the lookout for a head of emerging technology to develop our machine learning capabilities, lead the machine learning team and inspire the product and tech teams at Domain with machine learning!
A bit more about the role:
We have some 'domazing' brains here in the machine learning team. You will establish two scrum teams that are dedicated to machine learning and work to understand where we should focus our machine learning efforts to deliver a return on investment to Domain moving forward.
Yes, we already mentioned how great the machine learning team are but in this role we need you to collaborate outside of that team too. You will need to establish a solid working relationship with our product directors, our Chief Data Officer and his team of data scientists. This means day to day your role will involve a lot of cross collaboration.
As well as putting our employees here at Domain first we ALWAYS have our customers in mind. So your goal will be to focus on using machine learning to create assets that add value to customers.
And after you have done all this great work we want you to share it, we need you to establish a data products forum where the Emerging Tech and Data Science teams can showcase potential implementations and educate and inspire product and tech teams with machine learning.
So no, this isn't a hands on coding role but we do need you to come from a technical background and know a thing or two about how to architect AI systems!
You have landed yourself a pretty awesome bunch to help you achieve this:
In this role you will be lucky enough to sit on the tech leadership team with four other technology directors and will report into the CTO of Domain. Yes they are a hard working and clever bunch but are also a pretty sociable lot, always spotted at Friday drinks, at monthly birthday cakes socialising with their teams and are keen contributors at wider tech events and conferences.
Even your team are celebrities on the technical stage, with members of the machine learning team recently presenting at the Sydney Google Cloud Summit. Not only do we encourage the development of our engineers and employees at conferences, we also promote a flexible working environment and a relaxed dress code too.
When you are in the office we want to make it feel like a home away from home. If ping pong and gaming is your thing you will find the perfect place to take a break. Otherwise you can relax with a session at the gym or grab a large coffee to get you going in the morning, we have that covered with our onsite facilities.
If you think you can handle this lot there are a few things we need you to have:
4+ years of commercial experience with J2EE / .Net web technologies and architecture.
An impressive understanding of web technologies.
4+ years leading and motivating a dynamic team of 8 or more software developers for 4+ years.
Demonstrated experience forming teams around new technologies and capabilities.
A strong belief in the value of modern software development practices and processes, including agile development best practices.
Excellent communication, presentation and influence skills.
Exceptional analytical, troubleshooting and problem solving skills.
The ability to manage time efficiently across concurrent tasks.
Interested?
Go on then, click apply. We would love to see your application pop up!
So...what happens next?
We'll give your application the attention it deserves (you could be doing so many other things right now!) and you will hear from us either way! If you have the right experience, one of our Recruitment Consultants will give you a call (so make sure you keep your phone handy!) and from there the interviews will commence!

592	"Do you get excited when you start visualise a future where technology is driven by smarter machines?
Would you describe yourself as intellectually curious and 'obsessed' with new technology?
Is thinking outside the box the only way you think?
Imagine coming to work every day and using your innovative mind to transform the way in which the people in Australia view property.
Domain Group are on the lookout for a head of emerging technology to develop our machine learning capabilities, lead the machine learning team and inspire the product and tech teams at Domain with machine learning!
A bit more about the role:
We have some 'domazing' brains here in the machine learning team. You will establish two scrum teams that are dedicated to machine learning and work to understand where we should focus our machine learning efforts to deliver a return on investment to Domain moving forward.
Yes, we already mentioned how great the machine learning team are but in this role we need you to collaborate outside of that team too. You will need to establish a solid working relationship with our product directors, our Chief Data Officer and his team of data scientists. This means day to day your role will involve a lot of cross collaboration.
As well as putting our employees here at Domain first we ALWAYS have our customers in mind. So your goal will be to focus on using machine learning to create assets that add value to customers.
And after you have done all this great work we want you to share it, we need you to establish a data products forum where the Emerging Tech and Data Science teams can showcase potential implementations and educate and inspire product and tech teams with machine learning.
So no, this isn't a hands on coding role but we do need you to come from a technical background and know a thing or two about how to architect AI systems!
You have landed yourself a pretty awesome bunch to help you achieve this:
In this role you will be lucky enough to sit on the tech leadership team with four other technology directors and will report into the CTO of Domain. Yes they are a hard working and clever bunch but are also a pretty sociable lot, always spotted at Friday drinks, at monthly birthday cakes socialising with their teams and are keen contributors at wider tech events and conferences.
Even your team are celebrities on the technical stage, with members of the machine learning team recently presenting at the Sydney Google Cloud Summit. Not only do we encourage the development of our engineers and employees at conferences, we also promote a flexible working environment and a relaxed dress code too.
When you are in the office we want to make it feel like a home away from home. If ping pong and gaming is your thing you will find the perfect place to take a break. Otherwise you can relax with a session at the gym or grab a large coffee to get you going in the morning, we have that covered with our onsite facilities.
If you think you can handle this lot there are a few things we need you to have:
4+ years of commercial experience with J2EE / .Net web technologies and architecture.
An impressive understanding of web technologies.
4+ years leading and motivating a dynamic team of 8 or more software developers for 4+ years.
Demonstrated experience forming teams around new technologies and capabilities.
A strong belief in the value of modern software development practices and processes, including agile development best practices.
Excellent communication, presentation and influence skills.
Exceptional analytical, troubleshooting and problem solving skills.
The ability to manage time efficiently across concurrent tasks.
Interested?
Go on then, click apply. We would love to see your application pop up!
So...what happens next?
We'll give your application the attention it deserves (you could be doing so many other things right now!) and you will hear from us either way! If you have the right experience, one of our Recruitment Consultants will give you a call (so make sure you keep your phone handy!) and from there the interviews will commence!

Is thinking outside the box the only way you think?
Imagine coming to work every day and using your innovative mind to transform the way in which the people in Australia view property.
Domain Group are on the lookout for a head of emerging technology to develop our machine learning capabilities, lead the machine learning team and inspire the product and tech teams at Domain with machine learning!
A bit more about the role:
We have some 'domazing' brains here in the machine learning team. You will establish two scrum teams that are dedicated to machine learning and work to understand where we should focus our machine learning efforts to deliver a return on investment to Domain moving forward.
Yes, we already mentioned how great the machine learning team are but in this role we need you to collaborate outside of that team too. You will need to establish a solid working relationship with our product directors, our Chief Data Officer and his team of data scientists. This means day to day your role will involve a lot of cross collaboration.
As well as putting our employees here at Domain first we ALWAYS have our customers in mind. So your goal will be to focus on using machine learning to create assets that add value to customers.
And after you have done all this great work we want you to share it, we need you to establish a data products forum where the Emerging Tech and Data Science teams can showcase potential implementations and educate and inspire product and tech teams with machine learning.
So no, this isn't a hands on coding role but we do need you to come from a technical background and know a thing or two about how to architect AI systems!
You have landed yourself a pretty awesome bunch to help you achieve this:
In this role you will be lucky enough to sit on the tech leadership team with four other technology directors and will report into the CTO of Domain. Yes they are a hard working and clever bunch but are also a pretty sociable lot, always spotted at Friday drinks, at monthly birthday cakes socialising with their teams and are keen contributors at wider tech events and conferences.
Even your team are celebrities on the technical stage, with members of the machine learning team recently presenting at the Sydney Google Cloud Summit. Not only do we encourage the development of our engineers and employees at conferences, we also promote a flexible working environment and a relaxed dress code too.
When you are in the office we want to make it feel like a home away from home. If ping pong and gaming is your thing you will find the perfect place to take a break. Otherwise you can relax with a session at the gym or grab a large coffee to get you going in the morning, we have that covered with our onsite facilities.
If you think you can handle this lot there are a few things we need you to have:
4+ years of commercial experience with J2EE / .Net web technologies and architecture.
An impressive understanding of web technologies.
4+ years leading and motivating a dynamic team of 8 or more software developers for 4+ years.
Demonstrated experience forming teams around new technologies and capabilities.
A strong belief in the value of modern software development practices and processes, including agile development best practices.
Excellent communication, presentation and influence skills.
Exceptional analytical, troubleshooting and problem solving skills.

We are seeking a senior data scientist who has worked in a start-up (or small team) and implemented machine learning algorithms in production environments.

Exposure to building reliable Machine Learning infrastructure/pipelines and optimising models and code working closely alongside machine learning & data engineers is key to this role.

This particular requirement is mandatory as we want someone who has overcome similar challenges and problems and knows how to build products and get things deployed.

From a business acumen and cultural fit perspective, you will be well-acquainted with meeting deadlines under pressure and have the ability to draw the line and ship work that isn’t perfect (then iterate and improve later).


Required skills & experience:

4-5 years of experience in a data science role carrying out modelling and machine learning in a commercial, production environment – preferably a start-up or innovation lab
Strong SQL, R and Python skills – with experience in Linux OS and working to build real products/applications alongside engineers and dev teams
Good stakeholder management skills and pragmatism to identify the correct level of accuracy needed for different priorities and projects.
Insurance or dynamic pricing experience is advantageous but not mandatory
Passion for learning and keeping up to date with both techniques and developments in the fields of Machine Learning and data-related technologies
Spark, Scala, PySpark, Spark-SQL, SparklyR, Java experience would be nice to have.

What makes this role different:

This is an already successful start-up – well beyond the ‘early days’, with large revenue, recognition and already impressive growth in Australia and overseas markets.
Production ready: you have probably been looking for a legitimate, challenging role where your work isn’t shelved or looked at as ‘too hard to implement…’
This is a product-based company and data science is a key competitive advantage for them. Your work is central to their success and this role is due to growth, not catching-up to the market...
They have global scope and you would be working with high calibre peers and founders from Google, Yahoo, etc.

630	"Since 2002, our data teams have wrung every bit of information they can from our clients’ data in order to give them the insight they need to make a real difference to their business.

Times and technology have changed, but this remains our goal. Instead of wrangling single, SQL-based databases and ASP.net web applications, our MapR Hadoop platform runs across 200 nodes with multiple clusters and .net APIs and react.js/Angular 1&2 web products plugging in.

Our industry-leading partners’ real-world data sets and product requirements are growing along with their complexity so we need to bring more developers and engineers into our team. We’re hoping that’s you.

Predominately working with react.js, .net and Scala/Spark, you’ll be building applications to solve real world problems (some of the largest and most complex in the Southern Hemisphere) to make a real difference to our clients.

FAQ:

What is it I’ll be working on?

It depends, you may be initially building out scalable APIs to handle massive requests, onto a functional user interface that delights our clients. You may then end up picking up functional programming as this becomes progressively our company standard and transition toward Scala.Js or Reason.js

Fancy becoming as “Full Stack” [if you smile/grimace at the quotation marks, then you’re probably our kind of engineer] as you can? Depending on your progress and your chosen career path, there will be many opportunities for you to grow into our BigData space and become a Quantium full-stack engineer with genuine variety in your role

We’re pragmatists here with no fanboy allegiances. Want to use something new? If you can prove your case from an engineering and commercial perspective, then go for it! (Unless you're advocating for using Spark Streaming for a petabyte batch job. That was fun but ultimately nihilistic)

How do your teams work?

We work in multi-discipline teams so you’ll be working alongside Data Scientists, Analysts, Testers and Devops engineers, depending on the project

What are you looking for in the ideal candidate?

You’ve built web applications for highly complex data focused problems with the end user in mind

You’re a pragmatist, a true engineer and love to solve complex issues

You’ve a github profile showing us your experimental qualities. We’ll see combinations ruby, node.js, rust, python, java, Scala, Haskell, C++, C# or even Malboge with a readme that says “seeing how this works”.

Do you have a bullet point checklist for me to check off my suitability?

We know people are not bullet points but sure thing!

You have:

Experience developing web applications using a range of languages technologies
You understand how to build an API that can scale
A solid foundation in functional and/or object-oriented programming with data structures
A passion for solving problems and writing efficient applications
An awareness of considerations around structuring data on distributed systems to support analytic use cases
A passion for delivering high-quality, peer-reviewed, well-tested code
A love for knowledge sharing, you know what works, but you’re also happy to learn new methods and technology

We are seeking a senior data scientist who has worked in a start-up (or small team) and implemented machine learning algorithms in production environments.

Exposure to building reliable Machine Learning infrastructure/pipelines and optimising models and code working closely alongside machine learning & data engineers is key to this role.

This particular requirement is mandatory as we want someone who has overcome similar challenges and problems and knows how to build products and get things deployed.

From a business acumen and cultural fit perspective, you will be well-acquainted with meeting deadlines under pressure and have the ability to draw the line and ship work that isn’t perfect (then iterate and improve later).


Required skills & experience:

4-5 years of experience in a data science role carrying out modelling and machine learning in a commercial, production environment – preferably a start-up or innovation lab
Strong SQL, R and Python skills – with experience in Linux OS and working to build real products/applications alongside engineers and dev teams
Good stakeholder management skills and pragmatism to identify the correct level of accuracy needed for different priorities and projects.
Insurance or dynamic pricing experience is advantageous but not mandatory
Passion for learning and keeping up to date with both techniques and developments in the fields of Machine Learning and data-related technologies

What makes this role different:

This is an already successful start-up – well beyond the ‘early days’, with large revenue, recognition and already impressive growth in Australia and overseas markets.
Production ready: you have probably been looking for a legitimate, challenging role where your work isn’t shelved or looked at as ‘too hard to implement…’
This is a product-based company and data science is a key competitive advantage for them. Your work is central to their success and this role is due to growth, not catching-up to the market...
They have global scope and you would be working with high calibre peers and founders from Google, Yahoo, etc.
End-to-end work; if successful, you will be involved in the entire lifecycle from conception to build, finetuning, maintenance, productionisation and refinement.

If you are interested in this role, but have not been working on implementing and deploying machine learning models in production yet - please check some of our other openings, which may be more suited to you at this stage of your career.

We are seeking a senior data scientist who has worked in a start-up (or small team) and implemented machine learning algorithms in production environments.

Exposure to building reliable Machine Learning infrastructure/pipelines and optimising models and code working closely alongside machine learning & data engineers is key to this role.

This particular requirement is mandatory as we want someone who has overcome similar challenges and problems and knows how to build products and get things deployed.

From a business acumen and cultural fit perspective, you will be well-acquainted with meeting deadlines under pressure and have the ability to draw the line and ship work that isn’t perfect (then iterate and improve later).


Required skills & experience:

4-5 years of experience in a data science role carrying out modelling and machine learning in a commercial, production environment – preferably a start-up or innovation lab
Strong SQL, R and Python skills – with experience in Linux OS and working to build real products/applications alongside engineers and dev teams
Good stakeholder management skills and pragmatism to identify the correct level of accuracy needed for different priorities and projects.
Insurance or dynamic pricing experience is advantageous but not mandatory
Passion for learning and keeping up to date with both techniques and developments in the fields of Machine Learning and data-related technologies
Spark, Scala, PySpark, Spark-SQL, SparklyR, Java experience would be nice to have.

What makes this role different:

This is an already successful start-up – well beyond the ‘early days’, with large revenue, recognition and already impressive growth in Australia and overseas markets.
Production ready: you have probably been looking for a legitimate, challenging role where your work isn’t shelved or looked at as ‘too hard to implement…’
This is a product-based company and data science is a key competitive advantage for them. Your work is central to their success and this role is due to growth, not catching-up to the market...
They have global scope and you would be working with high calibre peers and founders from Google, Yahoo, etc.
End-to-end work; if successful, you will be involved in the entire lifecycle from conception to build, finetuning, maintenance, productionisation and refinement.

If you are interested in this role, but have not been working on implementing and deploying machine learning models in production yet - please check some of our other openings, which may be more suited to you at this stage of your career.

Ten time Webby award-winning Freelancer.com is the world's largest freelancing and crowdsourcing marketplace. We connect millions of employers to freelancers across the globe, and every day thousands of jobs are described, bid on, negotiated, and managed through our site.

Here at Freelancer our Product Designers (UX/UI) are focused on a user-centred design process to envision the way that more than 25 million people experience our product. You will work in a collaborative environment as a part of a design team and work closely with our Product Managers, Designers, Data Scientists, Engineers and Art Director to define User Research, Wire-framing, Prototyping, Visual Design and to iterate your designs with the team.
Requirements
There is no one kind of Designer at Freelancer, we're alway looking for people who can bring a new perspective to our teams. Be yourself and don't be shy to shine! Some important strings to your bow should include:

User Research
Knowing basic user research methods will be extremely helpful; our designers participate fully in user testing and often end up doing their own research.


Wire-framing & Prototyping
It is important to communicate your idea with the team both visually and verbally. To assist this, our designers might need to run a workshop with the teams or with our users. We won't force you to use particular prototyping tools but you must have a good idea when you would use low-fidelity (paper prototyping, wire-framing), medium-fidelity (clickable prototyping), and high-fidelity (custom code, motion) tools in which situation and why.


Visual Design
We use a modular approach within the atomic design process. Generally, the designer is applying an existing style guide but sometimes new components are also required.
Soft Skills
As a designer, you will work closely with Product Managers, Designers, Data Scientists, Engineers and our Art Director to help ship continually improving products. It is important to multi-task, iterate your designs quickly, gather and act on feedback and bring your product to life.
Benefits
This won’t be a cog-in-the-machine type of job; you will be joining a rapidly growing global technology company that values attitude and capability over experience, so if you are looking to make a difference and be rewarded for your efforts, this is the place for you.
We are striving to build one of the biggest sites on the Internet, so help us scale for 100+ million users, while enjoying all the perks of working in tech - fun atmosphere, smart people, awesome office, fully-stocked kitchens, social events, hackathons, your choice of platform, and more!

Ten time Webby award-winning Freelancer.com is the world's largest freelancing and crowdsourcing marketplace. We connect millions of employers to freelancers across the globe, and every day thousands of jobs are described, bid on, negotiated, and managed through our site.

Here at Freelancer our Product Designers (UX/UI) are focused on a user-centred design process to envision the way that more than 25 million people experience our product. You will work in a collaborative environment as a part of a design team and work closely with our Product Managers, Designers, Data Scientists, Engineers and Art Director to define User Research, Wire-framing, Prototyping, Visual Design and to iterate your designs with the team.
Requirements
There is no one kind of Designer at Freelancer, we're alway looking for people who can bring a new perspective to our teams. Be yourself and don't be shy to shine! Some important strings to your bow should include:

User Research
Knowing basic user research methods will be extremely helpful; our designers participate fully in user testing and often end up doing their own research.


Wire-framing & Prototyping
It is important to communicate your idea with the team both visually and verbally. To assist this, our designers might need to run a workshop with the teams or with our users. We won't force you to use particular prototyping tools but you must have a good idea when you would use low-fidelity (paper prototyping, wire-framing), medium-fidelity (clickable prototyping), and high-fidelity (custom code, motion) tools in which situation and why.


Visual Design
We use a modular approach within the atomic design process. Generally, the designer is applying an existing style guide but sometimes new components are also required.
Soft Skills
As a designer, you will work closely with Product Managers, Designers, Data Scientists, Engineers and our Art Director to help ship continually improving products. It is important to multi-task, iterate your designs quickly, gather and act on feedback and bring your product to life.
Benefits
This won’t be a cog-in-the-machine type of job; you will be joining a rapidly growing global technology company that values attitude and capability over experience, so if you are looking to make a difference and be rewarded for your efforts, this is the place for you.
We are striving to build one of the biggest sites on the Internet, so help us scale for 100+ million users, while enjoying all the perks of working in tech - fun atmosphere, smart people, awesome office, fully-stocked kitchens, social events, hackathons, your choice of platform, and more!

778	"The Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists

The Wentworth Group was formed in 2002 as an independent group of scientists, economists and business people with the objective of better connecting science to public policy in Australia. We work with governments, business leaders and citizens to improve the long term management and conservation of the Australian landscape.

Environmental accounting has been one of the Wentworth Group’s five core priorities over the past decade. The Wentworth Group’s Accounting for Nature model was first published by the Wentworth Group in 2008. It was designed to provide a practical and robust system to measure and track changes in the biophysical condition of environmental assets such as native vegetation, native fauna, soil, rivers, wetlands and estuaries.

In 2015, the Wentworth Group in association with NRM Regions Australia completed a continent-wide trial to test the practical application of the Accounting for Nature model at a landscape scale. Following the success of this trial, the Wentworth Group revised the method (Accounting for Nature, 2016) and advocated for a framework for a regionally based system of national environmental accounts to measure changes in the condition of Australia's environmental assets to inform local, regional and national land use planning and management (www.wentworthgroup.org/programs/environmental-accounts/).

In 2017, the Wentworth Group collaborated with three enterprises as part of a new trial to examine the feasibility of developing private sector environmental condition accounts: Kilter Rural, an agri-business managing mixed irrigated cropping and environmental grazing across aggregated farms in northern Victoria; Austral Fisheries who operate a Marine Stewardship Council certified Patagonian toothfish fishery in the World Heritage Heard Island and McDonald Islands region in the Southern Ocean; and the Tasmanian Land Conservancy for their Five Rivers Reserve located within the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area. Early outcomes of these trials are described in a recent report: 'Private sector trials of Accounting for Nature'.

We have since been approached by government and private sector organisations to use the Accounting for Nature method to measure the condition of a range of environmental assets to assist in informing the design, delivery and evaluation of programs, including measuring the co-benefits of land sector carbon abatement and water quality projects. We are now seeking a specialist to manage this work.

Role

We are seeking a scientist with extensive experience in data analysis, GIS and field surveys to join the Wentworth Group Secretariat to manage the environmental accounts program.

This 12 month position will involve advising on accreditation standards and establishing processes for the broader adoption of environmental accounting in Australia. It will also involve building capacity within governments, NRM regions and the private sector to undertake environmental condition accounting, including conducting workshops and supporting field trials of the Accounting for Nature model across diverse landscapes.

The suitable candidate will have:

Tertiary qualifications in environmental science, ecology or related discipline;
Have at least 5 years’ experience in natural resource management. Experience in environmental accounting is desirable;
Proficiency in data analysis, GIS and report writing;
Extensive experience in field surveys and data collection;
Well-developed communication skills and a personable, patient character;
High attention to detail and good time management skills;
Ability to work well both independently and in a team; and
Australian citizenship or permanent residency, or have a visa to work in Australia.
Location

Based in Sydney. Must be able to travel regularly, including to remote field sites.

Remuneration

Salary package commensurate with the qualifications and skills of the successful candidate within the range $80,000 to $100,000 (including superannuation).

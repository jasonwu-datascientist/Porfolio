We are seeking a senior data scientist who has worked in a start-up (or small team) and implemented machine learning algorithms in production environments.

Exposure to building reliable Machine Learning infrastructure/pipelines and optimising models and code working closely alongside machine learning & data engineers is key to this role.

This particular requirement is mandatory as we want someone who has overcome similar challenges and problems and knows how to build products and get things deployed.

From a business acumen and cultural fit perspective, you will be well-acquainted with meeting deadlines under pressure and have the ability to draw the line and ship work that isn’t perfect (then iterate and improve later).

Production ready: you have probably been looking for a legitimate, challenging role where your work isn’t shelved or looked at as ‘too hard to implement…’

Working in an Agile environment with a CI philosophy employed you will need to enjoy keeping current with new technologies, tools and methodologies and how they can be practically employed. Alternatively, first class Insights Analyst's will be considered regardless of level of coding although the more the merrier is my clients thoughts on this.
The ability to thrive is an environment where your core focus is complex problem solving on a daily basis is key.

This is an exciting time to be joining my client as they continue their growth internationally and continue to innovate in a vast variety of ways (e.g. Self Service Analytics/AI arena. Whilst these roles require first class technical capabilities equally important is the ability to understand business problems, business context, have a grasp of organisational and commercial realities and incorporate effectively all these diverse factors into the analytical features/services and algorithms that you build.
My client offers a first class working environment – professional, collegiate and creative all in one. Working alongside some of the finest Data Scientists and Software Engineers anywhere in Australia you can be sure that this role will offer fantastic challenges and opportunities with a real focus on your professional growth. Having a positive attitude towards your own self-development is key.
Ideally I am looking for applications from more Senior candidates (e.g. 5+yrs exp) who can assist with the bigger picture challenges associated with running a high performing product/feature development team although candidates with less experience but who can demonstrate they have the technical and business smarts to succeed in this environment should not hesitate to apply.

ProQuest Consulting is an innovative and successful Gold Salesforce Consulting partner, looking for a full-time Senior Agile Project Manager to join our team of talented consultants. By using our disciplined and rigorous Agile Scrum project delivery framework coupled with Extreme Programming, you will be responsible for managing the planning and execution of a range of Salesforce engagements, harnessing the power of the #1 enterprise cloud platform to deliver transformative solutions.
Running IT projects doesn't mean you need to wear the pain of working with teams convinced Scrum is just about daily standups, salespeople making irrational promises to clients with unworkable fixed price/fixed scope proposals, or long nights in video conferences with pedestrian offshore talent. There is a better way. By working in teams of on-shore-only experts, from our modern office in Circular Quay, ProQuest succeeded to build a reputation of outstanding governance and speed-to-value, getting customers live with tailored Salesforce solutions matching their unique business processes, in just a few weeks. You will be impressed by our execution.

You are...
a leader, empowering your team to achieve their goals.
highly organised, methodical and analytical, excelling at planning and reporting.
used to Participative and Coaching management styles - no coercion, no dictation.
comfortable with taking an active role in customer-facing workshops.
a great communicator, with strong emotional intelligence.
commercially savvy - you understand business goals and financial implications.
technically savvy - you know about software architecture and OOP.
You have…
5+ years of experience managing enterprise-level software implementation projects (CRM, ERP or similar).
proven experience leading cross-functional project teams in complex environments.
experience listening and understanding complex project issues.
ability to prioritise and manage customer expectations.
excellent oral, written and presentation skills.
outstanding attention to detail and adherence to deadlines.
strong negotiation skills.
Your typical day at ProQuest might look like...
It's Monday. You ride your bike and park it at 37 Pitt St. Quick shower on level 4, grab a coffee, and enjoy a healthy breakfast in the kitchen with the other ProQuesters sharing the highlights of your weekend. 9:30 is the weekly standup: you hear what the other teams have achieved last week, in relation to Excellence, the ProQuest core value of the week, and what they plan to achieve this week. You then speak for your team and share your project updates. One more banana bread and you head to a meeting room with your team for your daily project standup conf-call. Back to your desk, you go through the product backlog to list outstanding items, then give your customer a call to discuss them prior to this afternoon's refinement session, as well as helping on their change management strategy.
You see dumplings come through the door for lunch and realise that today is our weekly OneQuest knowledge sharing session. You grab a plate and a seat on the couch. Laura is presenting the Salesforce Field Service Lightning projects with SAP real-time integration that went live 2 weeks ago, and already generated massive benefits to the customer. Inspiring! You share a giphy on Slack in the #general channel to thank her for the awesome presentation.
You jump in a cab with your team to go and meet your customer for the usual fortnightly product backlog refinement session, where you help them articulate requirements, write user stories and acceptance criteria. Back to the office for poker sizing: you facilitate the session where the team whiteboards the solution and estimates their work. Great! You then run some reports and share a project update with your customer: everything's on track, but you've identified a couple of potential risks so you recommend what needs to be done. Time to blow off some steam so you grab a paddle and a worthy opponent for a match of table tennis in Winterfell (did we mention the conference rooms are named after Game of Thrones?).

operations
